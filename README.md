Software Engineering Project - an electric-car sharing software system design

Project for software engineering 2 - Politecnico di Milano

This project aims at designing an electric-car sharing software system. Car Sharing is a very cost-effective and useful service for anyone who needs a car occasionally. It allows people to use and pay for the car according to their personal use, without the hassle and costs of owning their own vehicle (parking, purchase costs, maintenance, insurance etc.). The system we will develop is meant for cities which are provided with an efficient amount of parking lots and a wide distribution of electric car- charging platforms throughout the urban areas. The application must allow the users which are registered to perform several easy and effective operations. Once logged in, the user can find available cars around him/her or in specified locations of the city, and chose the one to reserve. Afterwards the user, who needs to reach the car before a given time slot expiration, will be able, by unlocking the car using the app, to easily enter the vehicle and drive to his/her destination.
